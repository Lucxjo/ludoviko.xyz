        <h1>Blogging?</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my blog! I hope that you enjoy your stay here</p>
        <p>
            So a quick explaination as to why have a blog. 
            I have been working on a few different projects and I decided that this would be the best way to talk about my projects and how I'm progressing. 
            Despite this being the main reason, I'm going to also discuss other things about my life and causes that mean a lot to me.
            This will also include a post about <em>pride</em> later in this month.
        </p>
        <h2>Life?</h2>
        <p>
            So for those of you who don&#39;t know, Ludoviko isn&#39;t my legal name. I don't feel comfortable with the entire world knowing my full identity.
            Which poses the question as to how I'll talk about life.
            I'm planning to do this by excluding anything that could identify me unless extremely necessary.
            This should allow you to get a good grasp as to who I am as a person, while allowing me to keep a certain amount of anonymity.
        </p>
        <h2>Comments?</h2>
        <p>
            So I'm working on adding a comments system to this blog using <a href="https://cactus.chat">Cactus Comments</a>.
            The scripts for this are already on this page, it just won't load as I'm typing this but that could be because of issues with localhost.
            This comments system is built on top of the <a href="https://matrix.org">[matrix]</a> protocol.
            I do host a homeserver for [matrix] but the cactus comments works on their homeserver at the moment.
            You can send comments as anonymously as you like (just set your name to whatever you like)
            Feel free to join me on [matrix] though! My hosted webclient is available <a href="https://chat.saluton.cc">here</a> but you can also use any compatible client!
            My username is <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ludoviko:saluton.cc">@ludoviko:saluton.cc</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Not so final words?</h2>
        <p>
            So that was a lot of questions for a post. Don't worry, the titles of other posts won't all be questions!
            I am looking at improving my website in the future, which will include a complete restart.
            This includes an improvement to this blog to possibly include RSS/Atom feeds in the future!
        </p>

        <p>Until next time!</p>
        <p>Kun espero, Ludoviko</p>

    <p>
        I don't like websites and companies who use your data for no reason, so why would I?
        I try my best to use as very few companies as possible, this website itself is hosted on github and we use some third party companies but I have tried my best to use as few as possible.
    </p>
    <p>Okay so maybe I don't need to use a custom font through Google fonts but I want the best experience as possible for you.</p>

    <h3>Services</h3>
    <p>The services here could use your data in some way, not all of them do but I thought that it would be best to keep things transparent. I mean, we are friends, right?</p>

            <h4>Google Fonts</h4>
            <p>This is the most likeley service to use all of your data and what it does is pretty self-explanatory, it allows us to provide fonts so that you don't need to download them.</p>
